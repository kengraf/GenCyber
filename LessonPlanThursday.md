# UNH GenCyber : Thursday: “Virtual treasure hunts” Lesson Plan
Using tools and processes from earlier in the week, students will discover answers (treasure) for various historical events.

## Lesson Description
This lesson is divdied into three (3) modules; one each for New Hampshire, USA, and World events.  Story, location, and clues are presented as pins on a Google map.  Students are given a riddle or problem to solve that is related the story.

### Prerequisite Knowledge
Students should have a basic understanding of how to use a web browser and be able to engage using remote meeting tools.

### Length of Completion
The lesson has three (3) modules. Each module starts with a brief (5 minute) overview to provide context, instructions, and goals for the students.  Students typically complete each module in 90-120 minutes.  These lessons are based on Google Maps and Wikipedia.  
Search and Cyberchef knowledge is expected.
