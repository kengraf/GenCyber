## Resources & Requirements
- Each student needs to provide a personal story about an event in their life.
- Each student needs access to a browser
- Websites/Software used
 - [GenCyberCoin Game](https://github.com/vitalyford/gencybercoin)
 - [Hacksplaining](https://hacksplaining.com)

### Accommodations Needed
Special technical setup may be needed for students who are visually or physically impaired to use the
computer.

## LESSON LEARNING OUTCOMES
- Demonstrate the ability to think like an adversary and identify what can go wrong on a website
- Demonstrate the ability to use Internet resources to gather relavent information during a reconnaissance effort.
- Learn about different types of vulnerabilities that are typical for websites.
- Learn the basics of web ethical hacking and exploitation.

## LESSON DETAILS
### Assessment
The assessment for this lesson is a combination of observation and statistics of the
following:
- The number of students answering the Reconnaissance questions correctly (the OSINT Ninjas
page).
- The results of the Bug Bounty activity (the Hall of Fame page).
### Extension Activities on the Hacksplaing site
- Learn about additional web attacks.
### Extension Activities on the GenCyberCoin platform
- Learn about password strength, where to check if the email and password have been
compromised, and how to correctly manage it.
- Learn about digital currency.
- Learn about blockchain and its applications beyond cryptocurrency.
### Differentiated Learning Opportunities
Advanced students can learn more attacks and find more bugs within the allocated time and learn more by exploring the links
that are related to the found bugs. Also, advanced students can discover more sophisticated search
queries by spending more time reading the material provided in the Reconnaissance activity.
## LESSON
### Instructor Preparation
The instructor can learn herself how the platform works by watching a 12-minute video on
https://github.com/vitalyford/gencybercoin. Next, the instructor needs to follow the directions for
deploying on Heroku. After the system is deployed, the instructor logs in with
“gcsuperuser/gcsuperuser” credentials, changes the password, and shares the URL of the deployed
platform with her students. She can also create a code for her teaching assistants or herself to be
admins for the school if they would like to change anything on the market or create new badges and
activity information.
Student information
The instructor can show a 2-minute video about the GenCyberCoin platform to the students:
https://github.com/vitalyford/gencybercoin
Students navigate to the shared URL and register on the platform, selecting “Trial” at the very bottom of
the registration page.
## Lesson walthrough
- Validate student story is posted and visible to classmates.
- Register an account and explore the GenCyberCoin platform.
2. Navigate to Features → Bug Bounty to learn about what kinds of bugs to search for on the
platform. There are hints in place to help you find those bugs.
3. Navigate to Features → Reconnaissance to learn about Open Source Intelligence Gathering
(OSINT) and Social Engineering.
4. Answer as many questions as you can on the Reconnaissance page. Everybody can see
everyone’s progress on the OSINT Ninjas page.
5. Find as many bugs as you can on the Bug Bounty page. Everybody can see everyone’s progress
on the Hall of Fame page.
6. As you progress through the activities, you automatically earn GenCyberCoins and every
action/transaction is tracked on the Blockchain (Features → Blockchain).
7. Discuss the details of Reconnaissance and Bug Bounty as well as their implications in the real
world.
