### Python security coding.  
These lessons are based on IPython and use BinderHub and JupyterHub to create interactive environments.  

The audience isn't expected to be programming or security knowledgeable.

Four (4) lessons are provided in separate repos.  The lesson notebook provides step-by-step instructions.

1) Intro to Linux command line.  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kengraf/LinuxCommand/HEAD)

2) Using a railfence cipher [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kengraf/Railfence/HEAD)

3) Image based steganography [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kengraf/Steganography/HEAD)

4) TOTP (GoogleAuthenicator like) tokens [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kengraf/TOTP/HEAD)

The startup of Binder.org takes a minute or so to establish an IPython
environment.  Then click on the lesson link "LESSON.ipynb" you would like to run.  Feel free to play/alter the steps
in the lessons.  You will be working a temporary sandbox, so can not damage the original lesson. 

The Linux lab has separate instructions for connecting to the remote Kali instance this lab uses.
