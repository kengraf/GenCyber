# UNH GenCyber : Tuesday “A history of secrets” Lesson Plan
"A history of secrets" covers fundamental cipher operations to current everyday use of cryptography.

## Lesson Description
A "Cipher History" module introduces transposition and subsitiution as fundamental cipher operations. A second module "Modern Cipher" demonstrates how cryptography is used now in our daily lives.

### Prerequisite Knowledge
Students should have a basic understanding of how to use a web browser and be able to engage using remote meeting tools.

### Length of Completion
The lesson has two (2) modules each containing a set of lessons. Each lesson starts with a brief (15 minute) overview to provide context, instructions, and goals for the students.  Students are then a hands-on exercise that is typically completed in 10-30 minutes.  The modules and lessons have the following sequence.  

*"Cipher History" module*
Lesson: Transposition.  The hands-on exercies uses the Greek/Sparta Scytale cipher
Lesson: Substitution.		The hands-on exercies uses the Caesar cipher.
Lesson: Compound		The hands-on exercies uses Civil War messages encoded with the Vigenère cipher.
Lesson: Frequency Analysis		The hands-on exercies uses the Pringle can Enigma exercise
*"Modern Cryptography" module*
DX:TBD
lesson (AES, RSA)
