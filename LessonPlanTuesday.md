# UNH GenCyber : Tuesday “A history of secrets” Lesson Plan
"A history of secrets" covers fundamental cipher operations to current everyday use of cryptography.

## Lesson Description
A "Cipher History" module introduces transposition and subsitiution as fundamental cipher operations. A second module "Modern Cipher" demonstrates how cryptography is used now in our daily lives.

### Prerequisite Knowledge
Students should have a basic understanding of how to use a web browser and be able to engage using remote meeting tools.

### Length of Completion
The lesson has two (2) modules each containing a set of lessons. Each lesson starts with a brief (15 minute) overview to provide context, instructions, and goals for the students.  Students are then a hands-on exercise that is typically completed in 10-30 minutes.  The modules and lessons have the following sequence.  

*"Cipher History" module*
Lesson: Transposition.  The hands-on exercies uses the Greek/Sparta Scytale cipher
Lesson: Substitution.		The hands-on exercies uses the Caesar cipher.
Lesson: Frequency Analysis. 	The hands-on exercies uses Civil War messages encoded with the Vigenère cipher.
Lesson: Compound.		The hands-on exercies uses the Pringle can Enigma exercise.
*"Modern Cryptography" module*

## Resources & Requirements
- Each student needs access to a browser and have the ability to connect to the remote meeting with both video and audio.
- Websites/Software used  
[Pringles Enigma lab](http://wiki.franklinheath.co.uk/index.php/Enigma/Paper_Enigma )  
[Cyber Chef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)  
[Spy Museum](https://www.spymuseum.org/)  


## Accommodations Needed
Special technical setup may be needed for students who are visually or physically impaired to use the
computer or engage in a remote meeting.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES
- Demonstrate an understanding of ciphers based on transposiotn and subsitution.
- Demonstrate the ability to use Internet resources to perform cipher operations.
- Demonstrate the use of frequency analysis to decode enciphered messages.

## LESSON DETAILS
### Assessment
The assessment for this lesson is a combination of informal observation and game statistics:  
- The number of students completing the base hands-on exercise for each lesson.  
- The number of students attempting or completing the bonus exercises.

### Differentiated Learning Opportunities
Hands-on exercise provide a base challenge and one or more bonus challenges.  
Online resources are provided for self paced study.
